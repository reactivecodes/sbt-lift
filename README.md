SBT Lift
========

Using the Plugin
----------
This project is not *yet* considered stable enough for public use; hence
binaries are as yet not published to a public source. Internal SBS projects
may use the following dependency coordinates:

    addSbtPlugin("ke.co.sbsproperties" % "sbt-lift" % "0.1.0-+")
